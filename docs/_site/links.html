    * Link text - the text that will be displayed on front end of the site.
    * Link - the link that will be linked to.
    * Open in new window - if checked it will open the link a new window.
    * If you need to link to a file you can use the file link option.</p>

<p>File links - When adding file links you have the option to re-use previously uploaded files or upload new files. If a file is uploaded it will take the place of the “link” field when the HTML is output on the end user page.</p>
