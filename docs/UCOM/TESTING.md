* The [development environment](http://dev-creighton.acsitefactory.com) is intended for development and testing by the web devs.

* In the dev environment, the web developers will create content for testing. UCOM may be asked to verify a feature visually, but as development is still in progress, and code changes are made rapidly in this environment, it should _not_ be used for testing feedback.
