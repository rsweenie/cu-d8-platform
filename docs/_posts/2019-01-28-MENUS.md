## Overview

### 9 Schools and Colleges
![9 Schools and Colleges](images/9_schools_and_colleges.png "Screenshot of 9 Schools and Colleges menu")
This menu should only need to be set once per site, although it may need to be updated should a college or school be added, removed or have a name change.

### Breadcrumbs
![Bredcrumbs](images/breadcrumbs.png "Screenshot of breadcrumbs on a Content Page")
The Breadcrumbs menu is created and controlled by a custom module (cu_breadcrumbs). It automatically places a home button back to https://www.creighton.edu as the first breadcrumb on the left. Additional breadcrumbs will be added depending on the page and whether it appears in a menu. 

To place a link back to the home page of the site, though, you will need to add one. This should be the only link you will need to add to the menu.

#### Procedure for adding a link to the site
1. add a link (use a URL, not a drupal token, like <front>), following the procedures above
2. navigate to a page which should have a Breadcrumb menu
3. [Clear cache](clear-cache.html)

### Header Menu
![Header menu](images/header_menu.png "Header menu")
The header menu is editable either to make site-specific top-level navigation or to add the navigation of other sites (such as www.creighton.edu) across the top. 

### Information For
![Information For](images/information_for.png "Information For")
These "quick links" are site-specific information for visitors to that site.

### Main Navigation
![Main Navigation](images/main_navigation.png "Main Navigation")
All pages added to the menu will show here, nested appropriately under their parent pages.

### Menu Icons
![Menu Icons](images/menu_icons.png "Menu Icons")
At present these include the following "Make a Gift", "Campus Maps", and "A-Z Index". The images are created by UCOM and are set with CSS properties, so any additional links will need to created and added to the Drupal 8 platform codebase. The only difference in this menu is that the links must be exactly named one of the following:
* Make a Gift
* Campus Maps
* A-Z Index

### Resources
![Resources](images/resources.png "Resources")
Similar to the Menu Icons, there is a set of these links that can be added. They are and must be exactly named the following:
* Directory
* Office365
* BlueLine
* NEST
* Libraries
* Bookstore
* Calendar
* myCreighton
* Media

### Transaction Menu
![Transaction Menu](images/transaction_menu.png "Transaction Menu")
This menu is for calls to action and shows at the top of every page of the site.
